### About
This is a repository for my university work in my second semester in "Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen".  
It serves as a platform for me to learn and improve my Git skills and in the future hopefully also those of my fellow student and colleagues ... It is meant for them to get a look into the next semester's "Algorithm & Data Structures" module and the exercises there and may help to be better prepared and perhaps learn a little bit about git/github on the side. It'll explain some unnecessary things for total beginners, but this is nothing near a guide to anything particular.  

I'll share my code solutions and my exercise sheets here, and I will complete and update this repo until the end of my 2nd semester.  

Also I apologize for any mistakes, due to the fact that this is no major project of mine, but a simple exercise that I am doing without double checking everything. If there are any mistakes or suggestions for improvement, feel free to let me know! Contact me via: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/atlas976/Algorithms_and_Datastructures/issues).  
Nevertheless, I hope to help others with this, so enjoy!
